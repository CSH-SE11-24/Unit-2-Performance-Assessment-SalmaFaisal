My game is a modeling agency game where a player takes on a role of showcasing their talents and that they are worthy of the title "model". In this game, the player participates in model like activities to prepare themselves to perfom across the runway. Then the player has to get an actual certificate after earning love from supporters so that their position is official. The player answers questions from a company to invest in her products that they will model in their shows to come.
